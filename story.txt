Hi, this is yuli from xteam 76,I am from the China which is far from here. 
It is a pretty fall day, the sun is out, the leaves are falling. Bucky the badger was walking down the street and stopped Yuli. Yuli, what do you like to do?

Yuli was understandably freaked out. While a humanoid speaking badger hybrid is a fairly normal sight in Wisconsin, in far away China, they are few and far between. Bucky, asked her again "Yuli, what do you like to do?" There was only one real answer. "I like to run." And with that she ran away. 

She found herself in Alumni park, where she again caught a glimpse of Bucky, stoic and intimidating with his beady eyes. He must be a God the Wisconsinites worship she thought. And she wasn't entirely wrong. What a strange place she had found herself in.
